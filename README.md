Part 1 of Checkpoint 2:

The computation I chose is the Collatz Sequence: 
This sequence takes in a positive integer n and follows these rules:
If n is even, divide n by 2
If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1
Once n = 1, the sequence is over

The output is a string of all the numbers seen during the computation

Example input and output:
Input: 6
Output: 6,3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1
